Dr. Ashley Shade is an assistant professor in the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics at Michigan State University.  She has been leading the EDAMAME workshop since 2014.  Ashley has a Delta Certificate from the University of Wisconsin in Teaching-as-Research, and her teaching strategy involves continuous classroom feedback and student-directed, active learning.  Ashley is especially smitten with numerical ecology and multivariate analyses, and she speaks fluent R.  She often is pondering how rare microbial taxa contribute to their communities.  Ashley also loves tea, fermentation, Broadway, her snarky dog, and her awesome toddler (listed in no particular order).

Dr. Adina Howe [www.germslab.org](http://www.germslab.org) is an assistant professor in the
Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering at Iowa State
University.  Her research focuses on integrating traditional
microbiology approaches with metagenomics and computational biology as
investigative tools to understand environmental microbial populations.
She enjoys programming and teach others about how she learned to do
it.  You'll often find her playing volleyball, ultimate frisbee, or
with a dog on her lap.

Dr. Tracy K. Teal is the Executive Director of [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org) and an adjunct Assistant Professor in BEACON at Michigan State.
Through Data Carpentry she is working to train researchers in more effective
and reproducible data analysis and management. She is developing open-source 
bioinformatics tools for metagenomic analysis, and her research focuses on
understanding how agricultural practices 
affect soil microbial communities and how those communities might affect 
changes in the production and consumption of greenhouse gases. She likes 
the soil and computers, but not together, and climbing mountains when she
gets a chance.
