Weâ€™re excited to announce that we are accepting applications for the Explorations in Data Analyses for Metagenomic Advances in Microbial Ecology (EDAMAME) workshop at Kellogg Biological Station 10-20 July 2016.  EDAMAME is an intensive, hands-on course in microbial metagenome analyses, covering workflows from raw sequence analysis through to multivariate statistics and ecological interpretation.  

Please see our course website for more information (https://edamame-course.github.io/).  Application is available here (due March 21):  http://goo.gl/forms/Y3Cs0Bu2oB
